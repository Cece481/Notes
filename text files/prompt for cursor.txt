Enable automatic updates from GitHub.

I need to implement an auto-update feature for my Windows executable application that checks for updates from GitHub releases on startup.

Requirements:
1. When the .exe file is launched, automatically check my GitHub repository for new releases
2. Compare the current app version with the latest release version on GitHub
3. If a newer version is found:
   - Show a notification/dialog to the user
   - Download the new release automatically
   - Install/replace the current executable with the new version
   - Restart the application

Technical details:
- Language/Framework: [specify: C#, Python, Electron, Tauri, etc.]
- GitHub repository: [your-username/your-repo]
- Current version tracking: [how you track versions - e.g., version.txt, embedded in exe, etc.]

Please provide:
- Complete implementation code with error handling
- How to fetch the latest release from GitHub API
- How to safely replace the running executable
- User-friendly update prompts/notifications
- Fallback handling if GitHub is unreachable

Optional features I'd like:
- Skip this version option
- Automatic silent updates (or ask user first)
- Progress bar during download
- Rollback mechanism if update fails
